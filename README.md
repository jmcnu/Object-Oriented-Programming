Personal Bio:
I am a first generation college student from a small farming community. I took website development classes in high school and loved learning about code. I am LDS and served a mission to North Carolina after high school. I love to cook and bake. One of my faviorte things to do is to cook in dutch ovens. I entered my first dutch oven cook off last year and had one of my dishes win first place. Last year I picked up sewing and have been selling stuffed animals I make on the side. I can also do blankets and want to learn how to sew clothes. I am married and have a dog named luna. She is crazy and loves to do agility work. I currenlty work as a teachers aid at a middle school. 

Statment:
I went to a Snow college right out of high school. I love the small classes and my teachers at that college. I then tranfered to Southern Utah University and found myself struggling. I felt lost in the class and started to have problems passing some of my classes. As life keep coming I found myself falling farther and farther behind in getting a bachlor's degree. After seeing my brother do very well at a trade program I decided that I might as well give it a try and have a skill that could help me in the future. Since I had liked learning code in high school but never tried it in college I choose the software development program. I felt that at a trade school I would be able to get through the program and the math required. The math was want had scarred me out of doing it at the university. 

Goals:

Gain skills need to get a job in software development
Obtain a career in software development
Gain cofidence in my knowledge and skills of the industry
Gain a skill set that will help me through out my career
